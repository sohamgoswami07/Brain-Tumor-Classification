      <div class="details">
        Brain tumor classification software using AI and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) works by analyzing brain images (like MRIs) through layers of the network. The CNN automatically extracts features from the images, learns to identify patterns associated with different tumor types during training, and then classifies new images with high accuracy. This automated process helps in quickly and accurately diagnosing brain tumors.

          <h1><span>Types of brain tumor</span></h1>
          <p>
            Gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary tumors are three distinct types of brain tumors. Gliomas arise from glial cells and include various grades and subtypes. Meningiomas develop from the meninges, the brain's protective coverings, and are usually benign but can cause symptoms by compressing nearby structures. Pituitary tumors originate in the pituitary gland and can disrupt hormone production, leading to various hormonal disorders. Treatment for all three types may involve surgery, medication, and radiation, depending on the tumor's type, size, and location.

          <h1><span>Gliomas</span></h1>
          <p>
            Gliomas are brain tumors originating from glial cells, which support neurons. They include subtypes like oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, and ependymomas, and are graded from low (slow-growing) to high (fast-growing and aggressive). Symptoms vary but often involve headaches, seizures, and cognitive issues. Treatment generally involves surgery to remove the tumor, followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Due to their infiltrative nature, gliomas are challenging to treat effectively. Research is ongoing to improve therapies and outcomes.

          <h1><span>Meningioma</span></h1>
          <p>
            A meningioma is a type of brain tumor that arises from the meninges, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Typically benign and slow-growing, meningiomas can cause symptoms by pressing on the brain or nerves, leading to headaches, vision problems, or seizures. Though generally non-cancerous, they can still be serious due to their location and potential to impact brain function. Treatment often involves surgery to remove the tumor, and radiation therapy may be used if the tumor is inoperable or recurs. Regular monitoring is crucial to manage and address any growth.

          <h1><span>Pituitary</span></h1>
          <p>
            A pituitary brain tumor forms in the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain that regulates hormones. These tumors can affect hormone production, leading to conditions like Cushing’s disease, acromegaly, or hypothyroidism, depending on the type. Symptoms may include headaches, vision problems, and hormonal imbalances. Pituitary tumors can be benign or malignant, though most are non-cancerous. Treatment typically involves surgery, medication to regulate hormone levels, and sometimes radiation therapy. Early diagnosis and management are important to prevent complications and maintain overall health.
